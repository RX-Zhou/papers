This additional documentation includes:
## inputs
Contains the input files to compute:
+ electronic ground state;
+ phonons;
+ spectral functions (the epw inputs for the four different doping levels are labelled using the Fermi energy, in meV), 
  including the k-paths;
+ perturbed wavefunctions, including the real space mesh (near the origin and around 15 unic cells away).

## pseudo
Pseudopotentials needed for the calculations.

## data
Contains data files to reproduce the figures. The file names start by the figure number.

## code
Modified version of EPW (working with QE6.0) including screening from doped electrons, and the perturbed wavefunction.

## Paper
TeX file of the manuscript and supplementary information, .png figures from the manuscript.
